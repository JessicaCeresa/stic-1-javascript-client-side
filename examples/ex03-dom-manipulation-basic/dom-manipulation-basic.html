    <h1>DOM manipulation</h1>
    <p>Through the window.document (shortened to just document) JavaScript have access to the DOM and it can change the content of the DOM after the page has been loaded.</p>

    <p class="change-me">I will be changed by JavaScript</p>
    <p class="change-me">I will be changed by JavaScript</p>
    <p id="unique-p">I also will be changed by JavaScript</p>

    <script>
        /*
         * To manipulate the DOM you generally need to :
         * 1. Identify the elements you want to change
         * 2. Apply the changes using document.element properties and methods
         *
         * There are different methods to identify elements :
         * - document.getElementById(id);
         * - document.getElementByClassName(class);
         * - document.getElementByTagsName(tag);
         *
         * In this examples we will use two more powerful methods :
         * - document.querySelector(css identifier);
         * - document.querySelectorAll(css identifier);
         * They are similar, but the first identify just the first element that match the criteria, the second all of them.
         * querySelectorAll() creates a list of nodes, which is similar (but not identical!) to an array
         */

        //Select all p of class change-me
        var ps = document.querySelectorAll("p.change-me");
        //Iterate through the list of nodes
        for (var i = 0; i < ps.length; i++) {
            //Change the innerHTML (i.e. the content) of each node
            ps[i].innerHTML = "<em>I have been changed by JavaScript</em>";
        }

        //Select a p with id unique-p and change its innerHTML without using any variable
        document.querySelector("p#unique-p").innerHTML = "<strong>I have also been changed by JavaScript</strong>";
    </script>
