    <h1>DOM advanced</h1>

    <p>In this example we will combine some of the elements of the previous examples to create a quiz about capitals. We will use some advanced features to automatize the quiz.</p>

    <div id="quiz">

         * In previous examples we had to create and identify every element every time we wanted to ask a question, even if the procedure was very similar.
         * Now we will use some methods available from the document object to create nodes directly with JavaScript and assign listener to them
