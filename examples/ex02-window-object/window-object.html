    <h1>The window global object</h1>

    <p>JavaScript has access to the browser and to the page through the window global object. Open the console log for more details about the code in the script tag below.</p>

    <script>
        //When you create a variable in client side JavaScript, it is as if you add a property to the object window
        var myVar = "Hello, I am a var";
        console.log(window.myVar); //-->Hello, I am a var

        //The same with a function
        function printHello() {
            console.log("Hello, I am a function");
        }
        window.printHello(); //-->Hello, I am a function

        //The window object has some built-in properties/sub-objects
        var height = window.outerHeight;
        var width = window.outerHeight;
        console.log("Your current windows is", height, "x", width, "pixels");

        var currentPath = window.location.pathname;
        console.log("The current path is", currentPath);

        //Through the window.navigator object you can also access some info about the user's browser'
        var yourLang = window.navigator.language; //Gives something like fr-FR or en-US
        if (yourLang.substr(0, 2) == "en") {
            console.log("Hi there, how do you do?");
        } else {
            console.log("Sorry, I don't speak your language!");
        }

        //Since the window object is global, you can omit it. Every example above will work without window. in front of them.
